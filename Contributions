Semler - Im going to investigate the Country and Area of the shark attacks to get a better understanding of where the shark attacks occurred, and how to be more cautious of possible attacks.
Winsko - I will be looking into the possible correlation between the type of attack (provoked and unprovoked) with the possible activities of the victim. I would like to try a series of graphs, a stacked bar chart came to my mind first but also maybe a heat map would work as well. 
Odhong - I am going to look at the amount of shark attacks that occured during differentactivites and location. This could be able to show us if certain activites and locations have a higher number of attacks and if they are consistent.
