Semler - I believe most of the shark attacks recorded are going to be somewhere around the eastern coast of the united states due to florida being a hub for shark fishing. I think it's a good idea to look at all countries differently because of their popiulation and ecological outputs.
Kaleb - I beleive sharks attacks will most occur in warmer temperature and seasons typically during the day time due there being more people in the water.
