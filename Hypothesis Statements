Semler - I believe most of the shark attacks recorded are going to be somewhere around the eastern coast of the united states due to florida being a hub for shark fishing. I think it's a good idea to look at all countries differently because of their popiulation and ecological outputs.
Winsko - I hypothesize that those who do more aggressive or adventurous activities such as spearfishing and surfing are more prone to “provoked” attacks. I have to go and determine what activities that fit those descriptions, then do various graphs to match. I also have to take into account the possible extent of the provoking. Possibly there are certain activities that can lead to more provoked attacks. 
Odhong - I believe that the activity with the highest attacks is going to be surfing, as it makes victims look like prey, and spear-fishing, because those could become provoked attacks on sharks. I also think locations like the Bahamas and Australia are going to have the highest shark attack because many species of sharks live in the water surrounding.
Kaleb - I beleive sharks attacks will most occur in warmer temperature and seasons typically during the day time due there being more people in the water.
